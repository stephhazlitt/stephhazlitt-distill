However, there is always room to improve, even on amazing. I have enjoyed talking with our local government candidates, in particular about what issues motivated them to campaign to step into such important roles‚Äîthe housing crisis, responsible development, community building. In turn, I have had a fair bit to say about issues on my mind, such as climate change (this üò±), reducing speed limits in neighbourhood areas üöó, more and safer bike paths for family cycling üö≤, and, schools. Specifically, space in our only catchment elementary school‚ÄîL‚ÄôEcole Macaulay Elementary.\nEsquimalt used to have 2 catchment elementary schools, Lampson Street & Macaulay (Ecole Victor-Brodeur is also in Esquimalt, a school that serves the francophone community). Lampson, a school building with an impressive history in the region, was closed as a catchment elementary school in 2007 due to declining enrolment.\nHowever, things have and are changing‚Äîand pretty fast.\nDue to the recent, legal change to revert class size & composition back to 2002 levels, as well as a growing population‚ÄîMacaulay has added one or more new classes in each of the 3 years I have had kids in the school, as have many elementary schools throughout the Capital Regional District. Macaulay has over 470 kids enrolled this year, so I have been talking üó£ to candidates about how Macaulay is pretty full‚Äîand I think we need a plan for the kids that are still to come.\nI thought it would be interesting to support this discussion with some data. Also, I am always keen to work on my R skills üë©‚Äçüíª. So here it goes.\nPopulation Change in Victoria Census Metropolitan Area (2001-2017)\nLet‚Äôs start by pulling some population estimate data from Statistics Canada‚ÄîI found data for each Census Metropolitan Area by age group. Perfect. I had to Google to learn about what the Victoria Census Metropolitan Area (CMA) actually includes, turns out it includes all of the Capital Regional District minus the Gulf Islands.

This explains the decline in enrolment‚Äîand School District decisions to close schools at that time. However, 2014 brings a clear change‚Äîkid numbers start increasing.

However, there has been an uptick in recent years. In fact, all the Greater Victoria municipalities‚Äîexcept North Saanich‚Äîhad a measurable increase in popuation over the last 2 years‚ÄîVictoria a 1% increase, Esquimalt 3% and Sooke 11%! Wow, that is a lot.\nWhat I really want to know is how the population of kids is changing in Esquimalt.

We see the recent increases, and the projected increases to come‚Äîfor at least the next 15 years! I confess that while the animated plot is fun to make ü§ì, rolling the kid age group populations together and keeping things still really tells the story:\n\nYep, The Kids Are Coming\nOur Esquimalt catchment elementary school is full and the kid population estimate lines are going up‚Äîand predicted to do so for at least the next 15 years üìà. In my opinion, a plan for the kids that are still to come should be on the to-do list üìú for the Township of Esquimalt. The elementary school space crunch has already had community impacts throughout the Capital Regional District, displacing dedicated computer labs, after-school care situations, pre-schools. The School District recently launched a Catchment Boundary Review & Public Consultation‚Äîa great step in supporting planning. However, with only one catchment school and one boundary, I think it is also time to talk about bringing a second catchment elementary school (back) on line for Esquimalt kids üè´.\nDetails on the data sources (e.g.¬†website url, licences) are here\nThe R source code can be reviewed here\nLearn more about the CRD & Township of Esquimalt candidates here\nDon‚Äôt forget to get out and VOTE on October 20th, 2018\nThis post was originally published through GitHub.\n\n\n\n\n\n",

The full eBird data set is available for download, but it is updated quarterly‚Äîso will not have the very recent observation records we are after. Sigh üòû.\nThen I talked to Andy Teucher about my eBird data woes.

However, the rate of increase in observation frequency seems to be similar.\nLet‚Äôs look at all the Pacific Coast data now?\n#make a small df with just 2018 data\ndf_2018 <- ruhu_since_2002 %>% \n  filter(year == 2018) \n\nruhu_since_2002 %>% \n  ggplot(aes(x = week, y = frequency, group = year)) +\n  geom_line(aes(colour = \"grey\"),  alpha = .5) +\n  geom_line(data = df_2018, aes(colour = \"red\")) +\n  facet_wrap(~ state, ncol=1) +\n  scale_colour_manual(name=NULL,\n                      labels=c(\"2002-2017\", \"2018\"),\n                      values=c(\"grey\", \"red\")) +\n  theme_minimal()\n\nInteresting! But wait, while I‚Äôd like California to be a bit closer to British Columbia, I think I want the order of my facet plots to mirror the order along the Pacific Coast. Let‚Äôs make sure the variable state is a factor and in the order we want for plotting.\n#we need another package\nlibrary(forcats) #for wrangling factors\n\n#order for facet plotting\nwc_order <- c(\"CA-BC\",\"US-WA\",\"US-OR\",\"US-CA\")\n\n#make state a factor and order for facet plotting\nruhu_since_2002 <- ruhu_since_2002 %>% \n  mutate(state = factor(state, levels = wc_order))\n\n#make a small df with just 2018 data\ndf_2018 <- ruhu_since_2002 %>% \n  filter(year == 2018) \n\nruhu_since_2002 %>% \n  ggplot(aes(x = week, y = frequency, group = year)) +\n  geom_line(aes(colour = \"grey\"),  alpha = .5) +\n  geom_line(data = df_2018, aes(colour = \"red\")) +\n  facet_wrap(~ state, ncol=1) +\n  scale_colour_manual(name=NULL,\n                      labels=c(\"2002-2017\", \"2018\"),\n                      values=c(\"grey\", \"red\")) +\n  theme_minimal()\n\nLooks üëÄ better!\nAnd again, the plot confirms the original analysis‚Äîfirst observations are later and frequencies are lower for Rufous Hummingbirds, especially in Oregon, Washington and British Columbia.\nLet‚Äôs finish up with some window dressing for our plots, adding the usual suspects like a title and data attribution, and adding a nice silhouette of a hummingbird using the rphylopic R package üì¶. Andy even suggested using the rufous colour‚ÄîüíØ.\nSo final plot for British Columbia:\n#we need a couple more packages\nlibrary(rphylopic) #for image, package from GitHub\nlibrary(curl) #required by rphylopic function\n\n## add image\nhummer <- image_data(\"679605a3-95f1-4f57-be33-568640aca7b9\", size = \"512\")[[1]]\n\n#make a small df with just 2018 data\ndf_bc_2018 <- ruhu_since_2002 %>% \n  filter(state == \"CA-BC\", year == 2018) \n\nruhu_since_2002 %>% \n  filter(state == \"CA-BC\") %>% \n  ggplot(aes(x = week, y = frequency, group = year)) +\n  geom_line(aes(colour = \"grey\"),  alpha = .5) +\n  geom_line(data = df_bc_2018, aes(colour = \"orange3\")) +\n  scale_colour_manual(name=NULL,\n                      labels=c(\"2002-2017\", \"2018\"),\n                      values=c(\"grey\", \"orange3\")) +\n  labs(title = \"Frequency of Rufous Hummingbird Observations\\nin British Columbia (2002-2018)\",\n       caption = \"Data from eBird\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(legend.position = c(0.15, 0.3)) +\n  add_phylopic(hummer, alpha = .7, color = \"orange3\", ysize = 7, x = 45, y = .3)\n\nand final plot for the Pacific Coast:\n#order for facet plotting\nwc_order <- c(\"CA-BC\",\"US-WA\",\"US-OR\",\"US-CA\")\n\n#make state a factor and order for facet plotting\nruhu_since_2002 <- ruhu_since_2002 %>% \n  mutate(state = factor(state, levels = wc_order))\n\n#make a small df with just 2018 data\ndf_2018 <- ruhu_since_2002 %>% \n  filter(year == 2018) \n\nruhu_since_2002 %>% \n  ggplot(aes(x = week, y = frequency, group = year)) +\n  geom_line(aes(colour = \"grey\"),  alpha = .5) +\n  geom_line(data = df_2018, aes(colour = \"orange3\")) +\n  facet_wrap(~ state, ncol=1) +\n  scale_colour_manual(name=NULL,\n                      labels=c(\"2002-2017\", \"2018\"),\n                      values=c(\"grey\", \"orange3\")) +\n  labs(title = \"Frequency of Rufous Hummingbird Observations\\nAlong the Pacific Coast (2002-2018)\",\n       caption = \"Data from eBird\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(legend.position = \"bottom\") +\n  add_phylopic(hummer, alpha = .7, color = \"orange3\", ysize = 3, x = 45, y = .3)\n\nOK, I know. The silhouette is not a Rufous Hummingbird. It is a Topazza pella‚Äîthe Crimson Topaz‚Äîthe only hummingbird image in the phylopic library. At least it is a hummingbird?\nFor more on Rufous Hummingbirds (Selasphorus rufus), you can read the species account in the The Birds of North America series.\nFor keeping up with cool nature stuff in Victoria, British Columbia, you can follow the Victoria Natural History Society twitter feed.\nIf you see üëÄ a Rufous Hummingbird, you can add your observation to eBird.\n\nADDENDUM: AUK & a better hummingbird image\n\nIf you want to wrangle the full eBird data set, you might want to check out the R package üì¶ AUK, also recently onboarded at rOpenSci.\nAnd thanks to the above tweet from phylopic, we have a final, final set of plots with an improved hummingbird image üòÑ.\n\n\n\nThis exploration was a collaboration with Andy Teucher‚ÄîAndy told me about rebird üì¶, provided help with loops using the purrr üì¶, along with many other gReat suggestions.
